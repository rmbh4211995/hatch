The exercise is to build a list of `People from Star Wars` app based on data taken from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/). The design should match the screenshot above. Other screenshots are available in the `screenshots` directory.

### Functionality

The initial state of the app should show the first ten people provided in the `data` directory. The user should be able to click load more to load the next ten people, which should be added to the existing list. Once the user has gone through the entire list the button should reflect there are no more entries to be fetched.

Error states do not need to be handled.  

Below is a list of colors and sizing used in the designs:

```shell
  # colors
  Background Color: #F4F3F6
  Base Font Color: #2F1359
  Button Font Color: #6D5A8B
  Button Background Color: #EAE7EE

  # sizing
  Base Font Size: 16px
  Header Font Size: 24px
  Rounded Corner: 8px
```
